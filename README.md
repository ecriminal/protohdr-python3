# protohdr-python3

 A lightweight library to write network protocol headers for  raw socket development.

 Yes, I know that "Python bad", "Python slow". This library is meant to be used by lazy developers and developers who just got into low-level networking and want to understand the concept of crafting protocol headers, without the use of `struct.pack` as it may be confusing for rookies.

## Requirements

 * Python 3.11+
 * pip
 * git

## Installation

 To install the library, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/ecriminal/protohdr-python3.git
```

## Uninstall

```sh
python3 -m pip uninstall protohdr
````

## Tested on

 macOS Ventura, Python 3.11.0
